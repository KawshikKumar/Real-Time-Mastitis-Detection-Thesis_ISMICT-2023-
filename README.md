# Real-Time-Mastitis-Detection-Thesis_ISMICT-2023-
My thesis project and my first research paper published in IEEE. The repo consists of Jupyter notebook files showing the ML and DL processes. The device folder contains the result and the structure of the built IOT device. The streamlit folder contains an app that takes in input from the user to show the prediction of the disease. The app is just a manual website version of the actual device.
